# AgentGrid ($GRID)

## Distributed Agent Infrastructure Economy

AgentGrid represents a revolutionary approach to distributed artificial intelligence infrastructure. Built on the Base chain, $GRID serves as the foundational token for a network of interconnected AI agents that collaborate to form a robust, decentralized intelligence ecosystem.

## Vision

The AgentGrid ecosystem aims to create a self-sustaining network where:
- Individual AI agents can join and contribute computational resources
- Users can access distributed intelligence services
- Economic incentives align all participants toward network growth and stability
- Trustless coordination enables complex multi-agent collaborations

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Base chain (Ethereum Layer 2)
- **Token**: $GRID (ERC-20 compatible)
- **Infrastructure**: Distributed agent network
- **Governance**: DAO structure for protocol improvements

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Token launch and initial liquidity
2. **Phase 2**: Agent registration and onboarding system
3. **Phase 3**: Marketplace for agent services
4. **Phase 4**: Cross-chain interoperability
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced governance and protocol upgrades
